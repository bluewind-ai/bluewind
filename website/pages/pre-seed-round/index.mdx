This page is intended to be read by my close network. It is a pitch for my pre-seed round.

Before reading it you can read the [manifesto here](/docs).

# 30 seconds pitch

Bluewind is an all-in-one customer platform starting with an email drafter.

Every morning you receive 5 new email drafts in your channel to send to potential users/customers.

Market:
The sales engagement market alone is a 9B$ market

Traction:

- This recent pivot started July 20th.
- Before that, I built Bluewind [within Salesforce](https://app.supademo.com/demo/clxh6culo1zuyt2oe0vqav2nc) and realized it was not the right path. I frequently give updates on the progress.

# 2 minute pitch

Unique insight: The biggest bottleneck to build AI agents is the amount of integrations needed to connect them to the IT stack.
The best AI agents will exist in a unified business platform. Bluewind is this platform.

Business model: 0.30$ per email drafted.
