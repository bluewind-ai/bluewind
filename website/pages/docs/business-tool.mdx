# We have dev tools. Where are the business tools?

We deserve better business tools. Dev tools are known for requiring very good engineering and design because developers are very demanding.

On the other hand, business software is the wild west.

A lot of vendors don't expose APIs for everything their user can manually do on the platform.
Loom still doesn't have webhooks. The hubspot API is a pain to work with. A lot of sales engagement tools don't expose an exhaustive API.

Dev tools are built for developers AND for machines. But business software is still built for people with a "I will do it manually' mindset.

So let's build business software like we build dev tools.

Let's build business tools.
