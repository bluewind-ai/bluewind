The premise of Bluewind is that companies should have one single platform to manage their entire business.

Anytime organizations connect two vendors A and B, they end up building a piece of software C that is the sum of A, B, and the integration between A and B. When they do this multiple times with different vendors, they end up with an IT stack that is unique, very hard to monitor, maintain and improve.

As a result, it's very expensive for these organization to add new business processes and knowledge workers end up doing manual tasks that could easily be automated.

A lot of AI applications today aim to automate or streamline business processes, but fail to do so reliably not because LLMs are not smart enough, or because they need more context window, but simply because they need to do a lot of manual operations just to connect to the business stack of their customers.

If every company had the same underlying business platform, we could commoditize business processes and share them between companies. This would free up a lot of time for knowledge workers to perform higher value tasks.

Bluewind aims to become this business platform.
