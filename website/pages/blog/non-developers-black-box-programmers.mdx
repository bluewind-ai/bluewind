# Non developers will be the best black box programmers

Sometimes I code, instead of prompting Claude, out of pure laziness.

The truth is that: what scales is to prompt Claude. I have some utils I use to extract context, and they get better over time after prompting Claude a lot.

But sometimes, I can see an obvious mistake from the LLM and I fix it in the code. It doesn't scale.

A non developer wouldn't have the ability to see mistakes. He would be stuck. This is an example where ignorance can make you better at doing something.

The other thing is that I don't take much pleasure in prompting Claude compare to writing code myself. I HAVE to overcome this lack of enthusiasm.

A non developer doesn't need to overcome this.

Black box programming will enable business stakeholders to ship business software faster/cheaper/better than the duo of an engineer + a business stakeholder.

In particular if it's performed in safe environment where application performance and network calls are being monitored.
