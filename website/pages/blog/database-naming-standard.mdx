# Database naming standards

30 Jul, 2024

I was surprised to see there is no database naming standards. workspace, user, workspaces, users, workspaces_users, workspace_users, workspace_user, all of this is possible.

Same for field names. There is some common sense, but no one wrote rules to follow.

I think we should try to see if someone created a standard, and start saying: "We adopted the standards XYZ", so more people join the standards.

People joining the standards will get a backlink from the page and we will audit their tables on a monthly basis.
