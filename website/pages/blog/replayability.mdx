# Replayability

Such a key feature. It unlocks the ability to document, demo, log, test and debug.

I am really obsessed about being able to see the insides of Bluewind. Zoom in and out.

Being able to store everything so that debugging is treated as a first class citizen.

Profiling, traces, logs, I don't see them as things I should outsource to a third party.

In particular, logs are too important to outsource. Logs enable everything else.
