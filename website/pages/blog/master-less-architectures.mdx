# Master-less architectures in software and in life

Postgres has a master-slave architecture.
Cassandra master-less.

One of the consequences of this master-less design is that every Cassandra node is the same.

There is a reason Posgres is more popular. Master-slave architectures are simpler to build and understand.

However, the mindset that leads to master-slave architectures leads to other architectures in software and in society in general.

When you have 2 different roles, this invites 3 different roles.

And once you have 3, why not 4? 8? 16?

You end up with structures that look like big and complex organizations.

What would happen if you could design an organization where everyone has the same role?

I believe you would lead to better companies, more efficient.

And I believe it would also build better humans.

Is it for everyone? No. It's a nightmare to have to think about everything. However it forces you to see every individual as part of the same thing.

Having one single role in an organization forces you to find ONE day. THE day.

The day designed in such a way that you can repeat it over and over again, every day of your life.

I think I would want one core principle or Bluewind to be:

- How you spend a day is how you spend every day.
- Every employee at Bluewind does literally the same thing.
