# The difficulty with transparent wrappers

[Transparent wrappers](blog/transparent-wrappers) are hard to build because your users can put themselves in a state where you can't help them anymore.

Let's say you use [windmill](https://www.windmill.dev/) vscode extension and you try to change the yaml file describing the flow you're working with.

If windmill didn't build a syntax analyzer, you could be building an invalid yaml not following the [openflow spec](/blog/standardizing-our-workflows).
