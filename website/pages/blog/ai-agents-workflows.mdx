# AI agents make our work flow

The best mode in AutoGPT was not the autonomous mode. The "Auto" in AutoGPT is a trap.

The best user experiences were under the manual mode. In this mode, you would ask something and AutoGPT would come back with thoughts and a suggested action.

You would then correct the action or let it happen.

Suggesting actions is way more powerful than performing the action.

It allows you to put humans in the loop and improve the system.

So LLM-powered workflows (or AI agents) have the ability to move our work forward as opposed to traditional forms.

Forms are flows. They guide the user from one step to the next.

But they don't suggest what's next. And because of that they sometimes feel very boring to fill.

LPWs can improve flows by not only following a flow, but also make suggestions.

This is why AI agents make our work flow.
