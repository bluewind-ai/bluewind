# Suboptimal ubiquity

I have a pragmatic approach to technology: it's not the "best" technology that wins.

It's a complex trade-off between:

- how optimal the technology is at solving the problem
- how popular it is
- is it backed by a company?
- and many other things

For example Svelte is faster than React and gives you all the tools to build UIs. Whereas the React ecosystem gives you more freedom to build your own stack and be very sad a few months later because you made the wrong choices.

Svelte vs React feels a lot like Rust vs javascript (although Rust solves completely different problems than javascript)

But the React ecosystem is bigger, and with things like shadcn and next.js being backed by Vercel, you know that at least this thing is going somewhere.
