# Single tenant vs multi-tenant

Initially I was really into this idea to build a single tenant syste for every customer. I loved how supabase did it for their customers and it felt right that I do the same.

But it's going to create a lot of complications that are not the top priority at the moment. Provisioning these DBs is going to impact the user experience. So now I understand why Twenty went for a multi-tenant design.
