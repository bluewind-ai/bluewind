# Transparent wrappers

I think this concept is very important to build ubiquitous software.

Most wrappers give you an interface to interact with the thing they wrap.

But sometimes you want to see what's going on under the hood, and you even want to change things.

Transparent wrappers are wrappers that allow you to still have control on the underlying thing they wrap.

Here is a few examples of companies that follow this approach:

porter.dev wraps your AWS, Google Cloud (and I think Azure too) instances

Same for flightcontrol.dev.

Supabase wraps YOUR postgresql database but you can still do everything you would be able to do on this DB.

Windmill.dev provides you a low-code experience but everything can be exported to code (workflow as code).

Shadcn gives you these UI components, but you can easily modify all of them.

Salesforce allows gives you a Sales cloud experience, but you can still change everything about this app.

Transparent wrappers are the future of software and companies in general. They fundamentally provide a better user experience than traditional wrappers.

They are fundamentally ubiquitous and they prevent vendor lock-in.

But they're [very hard to build](/docs/difficulty-with-transparent-wrappers).

Which is why for now Bluewind will go multi-tenant. Which goes against the idea of transparent wrappers. Because in a mult-tenant environment we can't give root access to someone's DB since it's shared with other people.

However we will allow customers to export a whole dump of their data.

And we plan to offer single tenancy eventually.
