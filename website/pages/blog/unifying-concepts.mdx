# An example where merging 2 apps into one can be very beneficial

Here is an example where the 2 concepts that look very different use the same underlying data.

Product Demos and SOC 2 / HIPAA compliance.

When we do product demos we often have to use a sandbox environment to protect sensitive information. These sanboxes environments end up living a life of their own in your company. They are maintained and features are developed just for it. They consume a lot of resources in our business.

What if you could demo in prod? That sounds ridiculous right? But this could unlock A LOT of operational efficiency. Except the obvious problem is data privacy.

On the other hand, going through the SOC 2 or HIPAA process forces you to know WHAT is considered personal or sensitive information in your system.

So you can in theory create a user whose permission prevents it from seeing the right fields. You can even blur the right information. And it could just be a toggle on/off. Or even better. If you're in YOUR production system (with your data), you could SEE the sensitive information, but the person you do the demo to wouldn't. This would allow you to make your work "demoable" by default.
