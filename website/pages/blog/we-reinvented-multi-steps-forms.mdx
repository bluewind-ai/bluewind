# We reinvented multi-steps forms

AI agents make our work flow. And the best way they achieve this is by creating a conversation with us.

Multi-steps forms do exactly this. In fact, they're sometimes superior, because they offer a choice to the user: "Do you want yellow or green?".

So really multi-steps forms are the backbone of any business automation.

And I believe you close the loop once you manage to have one machine offering another machine to populate a form.

This duo user/suggester is really what constitutes an AI agent in my opinion.

The user has an intent but the suggester has the expertise and the knowledge. And our job is to:

- inject industry knowledge into suggesters (write forms, actions and data models)
- let a real user fill the form and see if he finds it useful
- streamline the form. Find the steps that take the most time or could be guessed by a machine.
- slowly but surely replace the user.
- close the loop and have a real AI agent that can autonomously solve one specific problem.
- rince and repeat for other problems.

Websites are really just forms. But what has changed is that now, machines can drive the work forward even more, with gen AI.
