# An other manifesto for Bluewind

Integrations suck:

- They are hard to build
- They are hard to maintain
- Every new customer you have might find a new bug in your integration because he has a different use case

This is a big problem right now because it limits good LLM-powered workflows.
Ask anyone building them, he will tell you that's one of their biggest pain points.
A good AI agent is supposed to understand you whole business. It's not enough to understand a tiny piece of it.

In practice this means potentially dozens of integrations just to get the data you need.
And once you have the data, you need to act on it. So 12 actions that integrate seemlessly with your customer's stack.

2 paths:

- embracing it. This is what unified APIs. But I think no matter how much we try, this will always suck.
- stop needing them. Build THE business software. It's possible. It's hard. But it's possible.

So at Bluewind we do build this software. And we start with the start of any business: go-to-market. This will allow us to attract SMBs and retain them with sticky features.

It's time for the great rebundling.
