# A crazy thought

VC money is here to make ambitious bets, right?

I had this thought: a lot of what slows down feature velocity is the risk of breaking things.

What if there is no risk? What if there is no user? No sensitive information?

No need to handle migrations? No backward compatibility issues?

Let's imagine a scenario like this.

Then what's the problem? You might be building useless things. Things that don't solve problems.

And you might also not be ready the day you launch, because you've worked in a vacuum.

Then, why not make your product only self-hostable and run simulations on it? These simulations would attempt to mimick the behavior of real users.
