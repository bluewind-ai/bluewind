# Don't use my workflow builder

I don't want people to use my workflow builder. I want them to use my workflows.

That's a really the sign of a good workflow builder: it produces useful workflows.

If people can just consume workflows and go back to their work without staying in my platform, I am in heaven.

Obviously, I will design my workflow builder to also be the place where I do all of my work, and I hope it becomes so good that people do the same.

But them staying on my platform is not the biggest indicator of success. The biggest indicator of success is that they complete the workflows I built for them.
