# Maybe you need to stop listening to external signals.

Me and my previous co-founder we watched the Github workspace announcement.

Github workspace was going to do exactly execute our roadmap.

And have you heard of github workspace now? I didn't.

We pivoted partially because of this announcement. Maybe we should have just not listened to it.

We had a pretty good echo chamber. We believed in our crazy ideas about building this AI coding agent.

We could have just kept believing it and build it. Did we really need these external signals?

Who knows where this would have led us to. Maybe a solid contender to Devin?

So maybe social medias, announcements, etc, etc... are also hurting you. Maybe you the only signals you need are those coming from your team and your customers.
