# "Legacy" UIs are not going away

I love what day.ai is trying to do because they seem to be following a [compound](/blog/compound-startups) approach to CRM.

But legacy UIs are not going away. They shouldn't be opposed to AI-driven UIs.

I think these UIs are made for different types of work.

We have UIs that make our work flow, like what day.ai suggests, and we have UIs that allows us to:

- see what's going on and decide what to do next.
- see things are happening correctly
- debug
- etc, etc...

I think [twenty's](https://twenty.com/) approach to building CRM is more powerful. They don't neglect the core building blocks necessary to build powerful user experiences. They've been working for more than a year just on making sure they get the core CRM platform right.

This approach is way more in line with building a compound startup, watch [this](/blog/compound-startups).

Parker mentions there how important it is to get the platform right.

You might successfully build these interfaces that drive the work forward, but if users can't zoom in and out of this experience, then this is not an empowering experience.

This concept of letting users zoom in an out of system is also linked to [transparent wrappers](/blog/transparent-wrappers).
