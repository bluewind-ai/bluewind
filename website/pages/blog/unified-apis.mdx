# Unified APIS

Unified APIs and Bluewind attempt to solve the same problem.

Unified APIs are very useful, but connecting 200 different business software to a unified API never leads to the same quality and control compared to a single cohesive business software. These unified APIs are only solving 80% of the most common use cases because if they were solving all the use cases, they would go out of business since this is a long-tail problem. Business processes are fundamentally very specific so they require perfect integrations between the data models they interact with. Most business software have parts of their data models that are just incompatible with other software, and a “human choice” has to be made to integrate these data models. In this case you have to “pick your poison” and
make trade-offs.
