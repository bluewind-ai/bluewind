# The best magic is the one people are used to

Svelte is criticized for looking magical. Whereas React is closer to javascript.

Personally I have nothing against magic and DSLs. I think we need them if we want to build better software faster.

But I think it takes time for magic to be accepted.

That's one of the things about Django. It doesn't look magical for people used to it. And a lot of people are used to it.

One thing about Svelte that differentiates it from  Django's way of doing things is that in Django it doesn't feel like it's beeing compiled.

Because the basic primitives of python are beeing used. I think Svelte suffers from real magic that is too far from the language.
