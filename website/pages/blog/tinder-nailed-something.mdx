# Tinder nailed something

Look, this is prodi.gy, and the UI looks very much like Tinder.

<Frame className="my-10" fullWidth>

</Frame>

One question per screen. Basic primitives:
YES
No
Ignore

prodi.gy has other exercises that involve different human inputs, for example labeling but for the most part these exercises are very simple.

In both the case of Tinder and prodi.gy, we're trying to train something so that it helps reach some truth:
Like:
"this is your ideal partner"
"this is a cat"
