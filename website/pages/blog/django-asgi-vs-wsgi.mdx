# Django ASGI vs WSGI

It's been a while I didn't touch Django so I looked into ASGI.
It looks like it's stable, but I am still going to go for WSGI for now.

I find this comment on the Django forum very interesting:
https://forum.djangoproject.com/t/understanding-a-dev-production-channels-async-setup-with-daphne-and-uvicorn/24259/7

Also, asynchronicity is overrated. Yes, it allows you to serve more requests. But it's not like you can't scale horizontally with WSGI.
And asynchronicity doesn't necessarilly allow for lower latencies.

So the benefits of ASGI:
- you get more throughput
- you get lower latency if you implement things correctly

downsides:
- relatively new for Django so it's likely I am going to find a django app that doesn't work with ASGI.
- it's more complex to implement

Boring is good.

PS: you still need ASGI
