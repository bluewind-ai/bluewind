# We need a standard database schema for the work we do

There is probably less than 1000 different "entities" we deal with every day.

Like when Salesforce said:
"We shall have leads and contacts. Leads are dirty data, and once they're qualified, they become a proper opportunity, contact and account"

"No, you're wrong, all of these things are persons. You should just have one entity called person. But yes, accounts and opportunities make sense. Also, when you promote a lead to contact this is very weird. Don't do that. Instead, create a contact type or something like that"

"You clearly don't understand that for most sales orgs, if they don't separate"

"But you can just do this in the VIEW layer!!! you don't need to create separate entities for that! Whatever app you deal with, "

Salesforce:
"I don't like it, it's making everyone do more work. It's less straightforward. Just listen to us. Oh, and we're the leader in the industry, so we will just do what we want."

And this is why we won't use schema.org to name our DB. We will just Salesforce.
