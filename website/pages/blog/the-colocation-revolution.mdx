# The colocation revolution

1. Getting rid of the necessity to manage your employee accross different tools by colocating all your employee needs in one place-> Rippling
2. Removing as much javascript code as possible on the client by colocating everything in your server -> HTMX
3. Removing the need for frontend engineers to rely on their backend team to do anything by colocating the client and the server-> Next.js and SSR in general

The pattern is the same: colocation.

I think a great rebundling is going to happen: less code, less tools, less employees, less complexity but more power.
