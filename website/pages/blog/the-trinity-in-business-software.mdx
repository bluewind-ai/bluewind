# The SaaS trinity

We say software scales. But it's not true for 2 main reasons. First, software doesn't scale with the number of engineers.
Second, go-to-market doesn't scale either, unless you intentionally design it for it to scale.

This is why business software has just gotten started and SaaS is currently living a renaissance.

To finally close the loop and truly experience scale at a level we've never seen before, we need:

- a product people use (1)
- a product generating this product
- a product bringing users for product number 1.

If you can't generate the product automatically, you're going to need more engineers to build it.
If you can't grow the product automatically, you're going to need more sellers to sell it.

I call that the SaaS trinity:

- App, app builder, growth engine
- the stuff, the thing that builds the stuff, and the thing that grows the stuff
- the binary, the software engineer, and the business person
- the code, the coder, and the seller
- the code, the code gen engine and the growth engine

Call them however you want. Until we productize the coder and the seller, we will not unlock the new level of scale that gen AI can unlock.

We've only done a third of the work.

Doing the remaining part CANNOT be done by buying 30 third party services, one for monitoring, one for code generation, product analytics, seo, email marketing, email outreach, etc, etc...

Why? Because you won't own your trinity. And you will get beaten by people who own it.

Why? Because they have control over it. They're not making api calls to a black box. They can maintain and improve their growth engine and code gen engine.

And the best of the best will unify the binary, the coder and the seller, to a point where you don't even realize that the binary is actually both the end user experience, what builds it and what sells it.

At this point, you don't have a business software, you have more than that. You have a business.

You're shipping businesses in a binary.
