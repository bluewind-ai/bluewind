# One flow, one business

Every plugin in Bluewind has a reason to exist. Without them Bluewind can't be built.

But for a while, I didn't how to unify these plugins. It's very hard to switch from the back-office to the documentation plugin.

The back-office exists because sometimes you want to SEE and edit your raw data. The documentation plugin exists because I need to crystalize how to use Bluewind.

But when I work on them individually, I end up losing grasp of the reason why they're built. And this makes me build a bunch of stuff I don't need.

So I started connecting my plugins together. One flow calls all the plugins when it needs them. This decision sped up development tremendously.

Because now everything is just part of one flow. And Bluewind already makes the claim that business software should be unified. So there is is always a natural and logical link between each plugin.

If there wasn't a link, people wouldn't get hired in a healthcare company to work on API documentation.

This "core flow" is the first thing I see every day. And there is only one giant flow, calling other flows, for very specific reasons.

Lineage becomes trivial: "hey why did you do this?" "well, look, this is called by this." "oh, I see."

I slowly realized that this flow became a literal representation of the business. And maybe this is the only UI that should exist?

If I introduce different user experiences for different people, maybe this would make them more siloed in their organization?

But maybe this silo is necessary to stay focus on one task? I am still not sure.
