# LLM powered workflows with humans in the loop

LLM powered workflows [make our work flow](/blog/ai-agents-workflows). But there is even more.

When you bring humans in the loop, you have something magical happening. Human intelligence is injected into this work.

This experience is also very engaging for humans because they get to interact with the work being done (that's why I think the best mode in AutoGPT is the manual mode).

We need to learn from [prodigy](https://prodi.gy/docs), [Scale AI](https://scale.com/), [LabelBox](https://labelbox.com/).

Because these companies know how to put humans in the loop.

I think that [business software is going to become a data labeling machine](/blog/bussines-software-and-data-labeling).

Because we're bringing more suggestions to humans, we now have to think in 2 ways about work: [proactive work vs reactive work](/blog/reactive-vs-proactive-time).
