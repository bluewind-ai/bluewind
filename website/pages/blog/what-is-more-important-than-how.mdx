# "What" is more important than "How"

This is my belief after building software for a while.

Once you have a system where you can focus on WHAT it did, over how it did it, you can reach peak feature velocity.

The best black box programmers know it. "Recording driven development" allows that. It works like this:

Any time you want to add code. You create a flow that does this:

- it creates stuff in a workspace and leaves the workspace in state A
- it performs an ATOMIC action (the smallest transformation possible) and leaves the workspace in state B

You over obsess about A and B and you don't care about the atomic action. You only focus on WHAT you want, not HOW you want it to be done.

What this allows you to do is to involve business folks. Because they don't care about your code.

But frankly, this also allows you to involve other devs. Because they also tend to NOT care about your code.

The ability for a framework to allows you to easily record behaviors through a change between 2 states is what 10x developer productivity.

And LLMs are extremely good at black box programming.

Couple this with a few linters to avoid common pitfalls the LLM does (or things you don't allow in your environment) and you have the perfect recipe to "build a software engineer". A software engineer is probably the most valuable anyone could build right now. Because that thing can create other things like no one else.
