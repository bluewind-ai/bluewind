# Uberization of Software development

It's something we want. Uberization here means anyone can build, maintain, improve the software you have.

Pay per task. Pay per feature. Pay per bug fix. Red team attacks the software (find bugs, vulnerabilities), blue team fixes.

We want that because once you can uberize software development you've built a very robust sofware management system. And by software system I am talking about all of the software you built to build the software, like rewarding workers, referencing them, find best practices, monitor, etc, etc..)

It's very hard to scale building software. I think whoever figures this out wins very bug.

I am convinced the key is to mix humans and LLMs. Humans labeling, testing, monitoring the software produced by LLMs.

And very very talented engineers building "the software for the software", which is a giant human labeling machine coupled with code generation mechanisms.
