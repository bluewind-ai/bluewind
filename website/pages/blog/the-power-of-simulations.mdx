# The power of simulations

You're free to imagine whatever you want. In software, the equivalent is having a system you completely own, with no third party dependencies.

What does this enable? Simulations. The same way you can simulate scenarios in your brain because you own it, it's now possible for your software to create its own world.

What are the benefits? Networks calls are expensive, flaky, brittle, fragile, slow. Simulating them allows you to run scenarios fast.

Which in turn allows you to iterate fast.

We had an interesting challenges when working on AutoGPT: the tests were really expensive to run. At the same time we had to run them, because:

1- gpt-4 was was not deterministic (even at temperature 0).
2- sometimes the prompt changed
3- same as 2, but more specific: sometimes the actions returned different thigns (which in turn changed the prompt)

I built a cassettes system that would record the network calls and replay them.

And anytime an HTTP request was about to be made, we would check the cassettes. If there was no cassettes, an HTTP call would be made.

This type of systems is very very powerful if it can be maintained. And maintenance was indeed challenging.

I think the "cassettes" paradigm is here to stay because it allows us to simulate the outside world with real data.

I am over obsessed about building the right tooling for bluewind right now.

The best customer platform is the best software engineer. And the best software engineer is the best black box software engineer.

Which means my customer platform needs to master tests so I can start black boxing features.

Black boxing means: defining scenarios and the expectations associated with them, and having the software become a consequence of these scenarios.

If done right, black boxing allows business stakeholders to build software faster, and oftentimes better than engineers.

Once we reach a state where true black boxing is possible, we can start performing "level 2 work" defining, correcting, monitoring, adjusting the behavior of our business applications, and having it self-correct, and eventually even anticipate our corrections (To anticipate corrections, we will need to define what a good correction is. I call this level 3, which means writing scenarios that define how the scenarios should be written, given a certain requirement. Level 3 tests the tester, you could say)

I keep dreaming about this day when I will produce 10X more business value than I do today. I know it's coming. There is a lot of grunt work required to get there.

The loop is about to get closed. The flywheel is about to start spinning. And it's unstoppable. And it will spin faster thanks to simulations.
