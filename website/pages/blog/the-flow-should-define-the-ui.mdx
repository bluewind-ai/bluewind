# The flow should define the UI

Workflows, business processes, SOPs, call them however you want.

My deep belief is that our user interfaces should reflect these flows.

And that's the problem with legacy UIs. They're not making the work flow. They're static.

They are [very much needed](/blog/legacy-uis-are-not-going-away) still, but we need more.

So how do we design a user interface that reflects the flows. What does that even mean?

I think what it means is that you the flow literally defines the UI. As inflexible as it sounds, I believe this is extremely important.

And Clay taught us something about this: it turns out [tables are a great way to represent workflows](/blog/clay-is-big).
