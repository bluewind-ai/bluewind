# Tertiary sectors are meant to serve the primary and secondary sectors

And I never forget that, whatever I do.

The software I produce is meant to enable other industries. If it's used by other software companies, great. But if it's ONLY used by software companies, it makes me sad.

I do think dev tools are a great example of tertiary products serving tertiary industries.

But really, the gold is in hardware: construction, agriculture, mining, healthcare, etc.

And by gold, I mean opportunities to improve our lifestyle as a whole: better food, houses, and health. And better usage of our resources in order to be able to sustainably indulge in things that are not necessary for our survival, like smartphones.

Every process that delivers value is an information system. And software enables us to support, maintain, optimize, monitor these systems. Or at least, good software should.

That's why I build Bluewind: commoditize software by making it better, cheaper, faster and easier to use, so we can raise the standards of how we manage our systems.

Because yes, software is all about managing and improving systems. And god knows how much we could improve the day to day systems we live in.

So, everyone keeps saying SaaS is dead.

But we still have plenty of software that doesn't efficiently support the information systems we rely on as a society.

What's dead might be the subscription-based business model of SaaS. Usage-based pricing, although very hard to sustain for a company, is a blessing for the consumer. So I would bet on this model in the long run.
