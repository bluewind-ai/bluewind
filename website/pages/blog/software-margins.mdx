# Software margins will go to < 20%

And we should be happy about it. But how do you make money then?

I think what limitless is doing is smart: hardware. Fully integrated user experience from hardware to software.

Software was never the goal. It was just a means to an end. Once software is "solved", we can finally disrupt all other industries quickly.

And we do this by integrating it to our day to day life. And here I am talking about physical integrations. Not software integrations.
