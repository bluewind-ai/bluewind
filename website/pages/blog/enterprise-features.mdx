# Enterprise features are not features for enterprises

They're features that are needed by every single company AND consumers.

I love the fact that the [SSO tax](https://ssotax.org/) funded some of my favorites open source companies. But it's time to stop. We can do better.

I have a particular hate for the SSO tax because it made my work so much harder: anytime I needed Bluewind to connect to the sales stack of my customers, it would require manual authentication from each provider. Because my customers don't have the money to pay for Hubspot's SSO tier.

This is one of the reasons I pivoted to building an all-in-one customer platform. The SSO tax is not going away. The only way to get rid of it is to build all-in-one software.
