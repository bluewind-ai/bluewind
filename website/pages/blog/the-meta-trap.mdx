# The meta trap

A year ago I started building a software engineer. Something that would write code.

And there is a big trap there: you can spend a lot of your time building the software engineer that builds the software engineer. Let's call this the level 2 SWE.

The level 1 SWE generates application code given a user input. Your CRUD, auth, controllers, models, migrations, validations.

The level 2 SWE gives you the code of the level 1 SWE, given a more involved input.

And it can be a big trap to work too much on level 2.
1- You can lose grasp of level 1.
2- It's harder to build.
3- Your needs keep changing.

I am trying not to fall into the same trap right now
