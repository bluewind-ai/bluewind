# Backends as a service

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kK-iR6g-V1g

There are a lot of sound arguments in this video from Theo. But there is one point that I disagree with.

People do not use AWS necessarilly to save money. but to have a single source of truth for their application.

The biggest downside of using third party services is not that they will cost you a lot at scale.

It's that you have a fragmented application. You connect to service X to do auth, service Y for your DB, service Z for your serverless functions, service T to host your backend, etc, etc...

Before you know it, you keep switching between tabs, and when you need to make a change, your github repo is not even your source of truth. Your source of truth is spread across your github repo and the 5 other third-party apps you use.

So yes I am using AWS for everything, but it's not to save money. It's to have a single source of truth for my app.

I would be curious to know if Theo has a different perspective on this topic today.
