# The best agent frameworks are just software frameworks

Agents are all about business logic. Django, Rails, Laravel, NestJS, .Net, Sprint Boot, that's what these frameworks are all about.

We created agent frameworks outside of these all-batteries included frameworks. That was a mistake.

We don't have a "flow" problem with out current agent frameworks. Most of them do this very well.

What they struggle with is quick and snappy data modeling.

Look how many agents help you send emails. Do they help you create and own YOUR messages table? Maybe, if you connect it to supabase.

None of them say: "Hey, this is an email flow, it will send an email. Oh and it automatically populates this table "messages" that WE own. And since we own it, we can help you even more and listen to these messages, by connecting to your GMAIL. We have built in automations just for that."

For magic to happen, flows need to marry data models. And let's use our good old frameworks for that instead of reinventing the wheels.

Let's make our work flow.
