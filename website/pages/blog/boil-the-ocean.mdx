# Boil the ocean

I think we should strive for exhaustive solutions. There are probably less than 1 billion useful SOPs in this world.

We should attempt to unify things as much as possible and try to cover all the use cases we have in business software.

Because if we can't achieve this, we will have to rely on other systems and integrate them.

Obviously there are things that are not worth building in my opinion: social networks, or infrastructure like stripe, plaid, AWS. And maybe github too.

P.S: I am saying maybe github because not owning your github code repository is a big deal. Look at odoo.sh. Odoo is helping their customers on the full lifecycle of an odoo project. They're building their own github.
