Django 3.2.3 release notes
==========================

*May 13, 2021*

Django 3.2.3 fixes several bugs in 3.2.2.

Bugfixes
========

* Prepared for ``mysqlclient`` > 2.0.3 support (:ticket:`32732`).

* Fixed a regression in Django 3.2 that caused the incorrect filtering of
  querysets combined with the ``|`` operator (:ticket:`32717`).

* Fixed a regression in Django 3.2.1 where saving ``FileField`` would raise a
  ``SuspiciousFileOperation`` even when a custom
  :attr:`~django.db.models.FileField.upload_to` returns a valid file path
  (:ticket:`32718`).
