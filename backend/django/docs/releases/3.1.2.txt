Django 3.1.2 release notes
==========================

*October 1, 2020*

Django 3.1.2 fixes several bugs in 3.1.1.

Bugfixes
========

* Fixed a bug in Django 3.1 where ``FileField`` instances with a callable
  storage were not correctly deconstructed (:ticket:`31941`).

* Fixed a regression in Django 3.1 where the :attr:`.QuerySet.ordered`
  attribute returned incorrectly ``True`` for ``GROUP BY`` queries (e.g.
  ``.annotate().values()``) on models with ``Meta.ordering``. A model's
  ``Meta.ordering`` doesn't affect such queries (:ticket:`31990`).

* Fixed a regression in Django 3.1 where a queryset would crash if it contained
  an aggregation and a ``Q`` object annotation (:ticket:`32007`).

* Fixed a bug in Django 3.1 where a test database was not synced during
  creation when using the :setting:`MIGRATE <TEST_MIGRATE>` test database
  setting (:ticket:`32012`).

* Fixed a ``django.contrib.admin.EmptyFieldListFilter`` crash when using on a
  ``GenericRelation`` (:ticket:`32038`).

* Fixed a regression in Django 3.1.1 where the admin changelist filter sidebar
  would not scroll for a long list of available filters (:ticket:`31986`).
