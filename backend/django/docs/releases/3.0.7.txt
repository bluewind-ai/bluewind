Django 3.0.7 release notes
==========================

*June 3, 2020*

Django 3.0.7 fixes two security issues and several bugs in 3.0.6.

CVE-2020-13254: Potential data leakage via malformed memcached keys
===================================================================

In cases where a memcached backend does not perform key validation, passing
malformed cache keys could result in a key collision, and potential data
leakage. In order to avoid this vulnerability, key validation is added to the
memcached cache backends.

CVE-2020-13596: Possible XSS via admin ``ForeignKeyRawIdWidget``
================================================================

Query parameters for the admin ``ForeignKeyRawIdWidget`` were not properly URL
encoded, posing an XSS attack vector. ``ForeignKeyRawIdWidget`` now
ensures query parameters are correctly URL encoded.

  a queryset has multiple subqueries annotations (:ticket:`31568`).

  (:ticket:`31570`).

  the admin from 3.4.1 to 3.5.1.
