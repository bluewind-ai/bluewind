Django 2.0.10 release notes
===========================

*January 4, 2019*

Django 2.0.10 fixes a security issue and several bugs in 2.0.9.

CVE-2019-3498: Content spoofing possibility in the default 404 page
-------------------------------------------------------------------

An attacker could craft a malicious URL that could make spoofed content appear
on the default page generated by the ``django.views.defaults.page_not_found()``
view.

The URL path is no longer displayed in the default 404 template and the
``request_path`` context variable is now quoted to fix the issue for custom
templates that use the path.

Bugfixes
========

* Prevented repetitive calls to ``geos_version_tuple()`` in the ``WKBWriter``
  class in an attempt to fix a random crash involving ``LooseVersion`` since
  Django 2.0.6 (:ticket:`29959`).

* Fixed a schema corruption issue on SQLite 3.26+. You might have to drop and
  rebuild your SQLite database if you applied a migration while using an older
  version of Django with SQLite 3.26 or later (:ticket:`29182`).

* Prevented SQLite schema alterations while foreign key checks are enabled to
  avoid the possibility of schema corruption (:ticket:`30023`).
