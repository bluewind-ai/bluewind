==========================

*December 3, 2018*

Django 2.1.4 fixes several bugs in 2.1.3.

Bugfixes
========

  lowercasing all passwords to match the format expected by the validator
  (:ticket:`29952`).

  class in an attempt to fix a random crash involving ``LooseVersion``
  (:ticket:`29959`).

* Fixed keep-alive support in ``runserver`` after it was disabled to fix
  another issue in Django 2.0 (:ticket:`29849`).

  ``ModelAdmin.prepopulated_fields`` (:ticket:`29929`).

* Fixed "Please correct the errors below" error message when editing an object
  in the admin if the user only has the "view" permission on inlines
  (:ticket:`29930`).
