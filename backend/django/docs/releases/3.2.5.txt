Django 3.2.5 release notes
==========================

*July 1, 2021*

Django 3.2.5 fixes a security issue with severity "high" and several bugs in
3.2.4. Also, the latest string translations from Transifex are incorporated.

CVE-2021-35042: Potential SQL injection via unsanitized ``QuerySet.order_by()`` input
=====================================================================================

Unsanitized user input passed to ``QuerySet.order_by()`` could bypass intended
column reference validation in path marked for deprecation resulting in a
potential SQL injection even if a deprecation warning is emitted.

As a mitigation the strict column reference validation was restored for the
duration of the deprecation period. This regression appeared in 3.1 as a side
effect of fixing :ticket:`31426`.

The issue is not present in the main branch as the deprecated path has been
removed.
