Django 5.0.1 fixes several bugs in 5.0.

Bugfixes
========

* Reallowed, following a regression in Django 5.0, using a foreign key to a
  model with a primary key that is not ``AutoField`` in
  :attr:`.ModelAdmin.list_filter` (:ticket:`35020`).

* Fixed a long standing bug in handling the ``RETURNING INTO`` clause that
  caused a crash when creating a model instance with a ``GeneratedField`` which
  ``output_field`` had backend-specific converters (:ticket:`35024`).

* Fixed a regression in Django 5.0 that caused a crash of ``Model.save()`` for
  models with both ``GeneratedField`` and ``ForeignKey`` fields
  (:ticket:`35019`).

  adding a ``GeneratedField`` with ``output_field=BooleanField``
  (:ticket:`35018`).

  overflow the page and become non-interactive (:ticket:`35012`).

  names from ``FilteredRelation()`` (:ticket:`35050`).

  ``ModelAdmin.filter_horizontal`` or ``filter_vertical`` contained a reverse
  many-to-many relation with ``related_name`` (:ticket:`35056`).
