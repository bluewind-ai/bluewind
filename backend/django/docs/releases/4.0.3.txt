Django 4.0.3 release notes
==========================

*March 1, 2022*

Django 4.0.3 fixes several bugs in 4.0.2. Also, all Python code in Django is
reformatted with :pypi:`black`.

Bugfixes
========

* Prevented, following a regression in Django 4.0.1, :djadmin:`makemigrations`
  from generating infinite migrations for a model with ``ManyToManyField`` to
  a lowercased swappable model such as ``'auth.user'`` (:ticket:`33515`).

* Fixed a regression in Django 4.0 that caused a crash when rendering invalid
  inlines with :attr:`~django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.readonly_fields` in the
  admin (:ticket:`33547`).
