Contributing to Django
======================

Django is a community that lives on its volunteers. As it keeps growing, we
always need more people to help others. You can contribute in many ways, either
on the framework itself or in the wider ecosystem.

Work on the Django framework
============================

The work on Django itself falls into three major areas:

Writing code üíª
---------------

Fix a bug, or add a new feature. You can make a pull request and see **your
code** in the next version of Django!

Start from the :doc:`writing-code/index` docs.

Writing documentation ‚úçÔ∏è
------------------------

Django's documentation is one of its key strengths. It's informative and
thorough. You can help to improve the documentation and keep it relevant as the
framework evolves.

See :doc:`writing-documentation` for more.

Localizing Django üó∫Ô∏è
--------------------

Django is translated into over 100 languages - There's even some translation
for Klingon?! The i18n team is always looking for translators to help maintain
and increase language reach.

See :doc:`localizing` to help translate Django.

Contributing guide üìñ
=====================

If you think working *with* Django is fun, wait until you start working *on*

Join the Django community ‚ù§Ô∏è
============================

We're passionate about helping Django users make the jump to contributing
members of the community. There are several other ways you can help the
Django community and others to maintain a great ecosystem to work in:

* Join the `Django forum`_. This forum is a place for discussing the Django
  framework and applications and projects that use it. This is also a good
  place to ask and answer any questions related to installing, using, or
  contributing to Django.

* Join the |django-users| mailing list and answer questions. This
  mailing list has a huge audience, and we really want to maintain a
  friendly and helpful atmosphere. If you're new to the Django community,
  you should read the `posting guidelines`_.

* Join the `Django Discord server`_ or the `#django IRC channel`_ on
  Libera.Chat to discuss and answer questions. By explaining Django to other
  users, you're going to learn a lot about the framework yourself.

* Blog about Django. We syndicate all the Django blogs we know about on
  the `community page`_; if you'd like to see your blog on that page you
  can `register it here`_.

* Contribute to open-source Django projects, write some documentation, or
  release your own code as an open-source pluggable application. The
  ecosystem of pluggable applications is a big strength of Django, help us
  build it!

We're looking forward to working with you. Welcome aboard! ‚õµÔ∏è
